# 🎬 Film App Project

This is a basic film management project built to practice JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming concepts.  
I first developed this project using **pre-ES6** syntax (constructor functions and prototypes), and later rewrote it using **modern ES6+ class-based structure**.

The project demonstrates how a simple UI can interact with browser storage using **vanilla JavaScript**, without any external libraries or frameworks.

## 🚀 Features

- Add films to the UI  
- Show success/error alert messages  
- Save films to **Local Storage**  
- Load all films from storage on page load  
- Delete individual films from the UI and storage  
- Clear all films at once  
- Use of **ES6 Classes**  
- Two versions:  
  - `v1` → OOP with constructor functions (pre-ES6)  
  - `v2` → OOP with ES6+ classes
